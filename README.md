## Description
I allotted 4 hours to work on this project. I made a good bit of progress, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to complete every requirement laid out in the project document.

What was done:
* Built an interface to allow client-code to create a new machine. 
* Added a Pass and Task state.
* Added compile functionality to the macine and each of it's states.
* Added the ability to set state transitions.
* Added type information and unit tests.

What still needs to be added:
* The ability to simulate the machine.
* The ability for states to accept an input and return an output.
* Support for the Catch property on Task states.
* Basic functionality for the Map state.
